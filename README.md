# ETSU 

Repository for any/all of my programming related Computer Science coursework at East Tennessee State University

'My Libraries' currently contains one C# class composed of some generic methods I wrote to make input validation tasks
for Course Assignments easier, and will either expand or add new library files as I add new languages to my repertoire
