# CSCI1250

This is a repo to store/document my work in CSCI 1250 - Intro To Computer Science

All code contained is the completed/final/submitted versions of the assignments. In some cases there may be a _v(1, 2, 3, ..., n) where I had a different idea of how to do the assignment or what I felt could be an optimization etc.

The CSCI1250.cs under My Libraries/ is a class library containing a few Generic methods (including overlaods to cover certain use-cases) written by me not as an assignment, but as a way for me to:

&emsp;1. Practice/learn C# and programming concepts

&emsp;2. Make things easier by having a handful of tools to simplify common/repetitive tasks.
