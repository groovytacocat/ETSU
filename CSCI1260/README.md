# CSCI1260

This is a repo to store/document my work in CSCI 1260 - Intro To Computer Science II (Honors)

All code contained is the completed/final/submitted versions of the assignments. In some cases there may be a _v(1, 2, 3, ..., n) where I had a different idea of how to do the assignment or what I felt could be an optimization etc.
